# Teacher Tracker
My app allows a teacher to record their thoughts and student behaviors via a simple, intuitive platform.
- Documentation is vital for student evaluations and determining whether they qualify for legal services.
- As a teacher, having a quick & digital option would have been useful (compared to printed out paper charts which I had to manually upload).

## Features
The tracker has 2 separate forms:
- One for student behaviors
- One for teacher thoughts

Form data is mapped out on their respective pages, to reference as needed.

## Reflection
- This project afforded me the opportunity to:
- - review the fundamentals of React and Hooks to understand how each component and prop interacts.
- - implement a backend using python3 and django by myself (not in a group setting)
- - deploy via Heroku

## Challenges/Extensions
With more time, I'd love to:
- Integrate and utilize the back-end student model, to have each form associated with a student.
- Create filters to map out data related to each student.

Due to time constraints, I was unable to implement both of these features. While I have created a student user model and can map this value out on React, I'm unable to assign a student to each of the trackers on the front-end. I know it's possible because I can assign a student to a tracker in Django. After extensive research, multiple 1-on-1s with the teaching team, and brainstorming sessions with classmates, we haven't found a working solution in the week-long time frame. This is something I'd like to revisit: I wonder if it's a front-end issue (maybe I need to make an axios call to a different url) or a back-end issue (I'm still learning about Django's rest framework).
